## Introduction

FYPC (full name is "Fix Your PC - For All Your PC Needs!") is a web application that serves as PC, Laptops and Accessories for them shop and also as maintenance service center. The site is built using Django and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a simple way to find whatever you PC needs!

## Overview

FYPC - is an online electronics store focused on PC and related products. On the site, you can create orders, add items to your cart, and save items to your favorites. The site also features a custom admin panel built with Bootstrap, which is easier to use than the standard Django admin panel.
